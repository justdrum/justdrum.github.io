                    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="element1">Upon entering the field of education, I knew there would come a time when I would need to further my education and improve my skills, not only for myself but for my students and our school. After researching different degree programs at a number of different schools, I finally landed on the University of Missouri. The Information Science and Learning Technologies department, specifically. As a career and technical education teacher, I felt this program was perfect for me with its degree emphasis on technology in schools. I felt this would help bolster my own classroom teachings as well as bring me up to speed on all the latest technologies available in education.</p>
                    <p>With the technology landscape ever-changing, I felt this degree would be a vital resource in growing our departments' reach within the school. While some teachers prefer to stay away from technology, whether it be lack of knowledge or intimidation, I welcome it with open arms. The students want to have the ability to utilize the best and most up-to-date technology, so I felt it was a necessity for myself to be as fluent as possible out of respect for them. After gaining a first-class education on technology in the classroom, I feel well equipped to guide my students through use of technology in the education.</p>
                    <p>Prior to beginning this program in September of 2020, I was very limited in my knowledge of tools such as Canvas and Google Apps, not to mention my knowledge in game design and implementation to the classroom. I would definitely have labeled myself a novice in the areas of digital media in general, and limited to only entry-level knowledge with things such and audio and digital creativity. Through this program, I have expanded my knowledge not only in those fields, but also in things such as research skills, basic html and css work along with many other new found skills. </p>
                    <p>After having been in the program for over a year now, I find myself very aware of what media is available and how to utilize it to its fullest extent within my classroom.  Through the many classes I have taken, I have been enlightened to the ample opportunityâ€™s media provides for students to prepare for their future endeavors. Technology is challenging, but even more rewarding, this is the mindset I hope to convey to my current and future students. </p>
