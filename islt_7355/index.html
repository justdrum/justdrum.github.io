                <h3>Welcome Statement</h3>
                <p>Welcome to my web portfolio! This program portfolio was designed to display the concepts and ideas I have learned through my time in the Learning Technologies & Design: Technology in Schools program here at The University of Missouri. </P>
                    <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is to exhibit the work and content I have created during my time in the Learning Technologies & Design program. With this website, my goal is to provide useful information and examples to those searching for potential programs they would enjoy enrolling in. My website will also provide a place for me to display all of my achievements while studying at the University of Missouri. With these pieces in place, my hope is that viewers will find the educational benefits of enrolling in such an enriching program. Not only will this website serve as a place for future students to potentially determine their interest in our program, this online portfolio will become a location for current and future employers to see my work. </p>
