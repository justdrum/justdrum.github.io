                        <h2>Digital Video</h2>
                        <p id="project1">In Introduction to Digital Media, as students, we chose a lesson to create multiple mediums to deliver instruction. In the current state of the world, living in the midst of a pandemic, this project afforded the opportunity for students to not only learn the content in the classroom but remotely as well. Often times when out of the classroom, students fall behind but with offering multiple ways for students to engage in learning, it is more likely that they succeed. The benefit of a lesson like this is not just for students out of school, students that may be working on an assignment they did not finish in class may be able to go back and get direction or clarification on an item they are struggling with as well. This allows for the students to have support with or without the teacher physically with them. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G6U3hwgSC8"> Artifact</a>

                        <h2>SmartBoard</h2>
                        <p id="project2">In 2024 my high school, Lanphier High School, will open the doors to a brand new state-of-the art building. In the past year, we have had countless planning department and school-wide meetings to help provide input on our wishes and desires for the forthcoming building. In hopes of improving lectures and instruction, I was lucky to have worked on a project in  Technology to Enhance Learning that guided me towards requesting the use of SmartBoards for our new classrooms. With the numerous ways this tool may be used in class, it felt like something our department, and most departments would benefit from having. By 2024 I hope to be teaching from a SmartBoard and utilizing some of the strengths pointed to in our concept map.

                        <h2>Business Website</h2>
                        <p id="project3">In Learning With Web-based Technologies course, we were challenged with creating a website from scratch. The website would be a complete space for my Introduction to Business students to work through a lesson and build their project. The website was a bit challenging to start, as I had never built a site with this much information, especially one that would guide students from the beginning to the end of an entire project. By using the website, students will have everything they need to start their career research while working through to identify a main career choice. The website offers a timeline as checkpoints to help the students progress through the project as well.
