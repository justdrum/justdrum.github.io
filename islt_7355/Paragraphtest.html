    <body><p>This is a test paragraph to help you identify how the paragraph tag works. The paragraph tag is one of the most used tags in a webpage containing text because it provides a container so you can modify the text to look the way you want.

        When you use the paragraph tag, it automatically places a space between the first paragraph and the next. The paragraph should be used for all text that is not formatted through other tags to keep all of your content the way you want it.</p>
