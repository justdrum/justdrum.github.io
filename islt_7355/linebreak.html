    <h1>One Paragraph</h1>
    <body>With paragraphs, we can format text in a number of different ways. For instance, we can create paragraphs that are one large chunk of text, or we can break it into multiple smaller paragraphs. With paragraphs being one of the most used HTML elements, we have a lot of options to modify them to look the way we want. So, when we want to break a larger paragraph into smaller ones, we have some options. We can simply create two separate paragraph tag sets or we can simply place a line break element where we want the paragraphs to split. Either way will turn one paragraph into two, but the amount of space between them will be different. With two separate paragraph tag sets, you have a blank line between paragraphs but with a line break element, the second paragraph moves to the next line with no space between.</body>
