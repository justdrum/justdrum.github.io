    Hello, my name is Justin Hagerman. This is my final class here at Mizzou. Professionally, I teach in the Career and Technical Education Department (CTE). I currently teach at Lanphier High School in Springfield, Illinois. I have been at Lanphier for all four years of my teaching career. I am happily married and a father of four wonderful children. Our lives are a bit chaotic at points. This is due to all of the activities that our kids are involved in. This keeps my wife and I busy and the kids happy. In what free time I can spare I enjoy watching sports, I am a huge Packers fan. I also play drums. Although I do not play as much as I had in the past, I still find some time to squeeze it in here and there. My family and I enjoy traveling. We are very much looking forward to taking another summer vacation this year.
