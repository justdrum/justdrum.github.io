                    <p>Hello, my name is Justin Hagerman. This is my final class here at Mizzou. I currently teach at Lanphier High School in Springfield, Illinois. I have been at Lanphier for all four years of my teaching career. I have very limited coding experience and look forward to learning. I am happily married and a father of four wonderful children. Our lives are a bit chaotic at points. This is due to all of the activities that our kids are involved in. This keeps my wife and I busy and the kids happy. In what free time I can spare I enjoy watching sports, I am a huge Packers fan. I also play drums. Although I do not play as much as I had in the past, I still find some time to squeeze it in here and there. My family and I enjoy traveling. We are very much looking forward to taking another summer vacation this year.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Education Overview</h3>

    <p>After graduating with my Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, I quickly realized that I was looking for a more fulfilling role in my professional life. I had worked for the same company for my entire adult life was in desperate need of a change. After some deep reflection and conversations with my wife, I had determined that my path would be headed towards teaching.<br/> I earned my teaching licensure through Mississippi State University in 2018 as was lucky to be hired into a provisional role at Lanphier High School in Springfield, Illinois. This provisional role allowed me the ability to bypass student teaching and enter the classroom as a teacher immediately. I have been a Career and Technical Education Teacher for the past 4 years. In 2020, I enrolled in the Learning Technologies & Design: Technology in Schools program at Mizzou. I look forward to graduating with my master’s degree in Spring of 2022. </p>
